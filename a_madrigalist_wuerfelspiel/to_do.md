# TO-DO

- [ x ] Generate realizations of given schema
- [ ] Calculate base parameters for realization (percentual values)
- [ ] Ingest poems
- [ ] Visualizations: pyvis graph, export schema and realization to lilypond
- [x ] Assemblage and algorithm based on parameters and chance (3d6 or 2d6)


# Conversions

- [ ] Modal transpositions do not take into account the octave notation....Use abjad.

# Assemblage

- [ x] Create transitions constraints to keep consistency of modes.
